## Deployment instructions

1. Download the necessary files (`AutoRestart.py`,`Carat.py`, `utility.py`, the `Cogs` directory) and make sure they are arranged correctly (`Carat.py` and `utility.py`, and the `Cogs` directory all lying in the same directory)
2. Install the necessary packages (`nextcord`, `python-dotenv`, `dataclasses-json`) - typically you'll want to use pip for this, with `pip install [package name]`. The other packages used should be included in your python installation.
3. Create a file called `.env`, if you don't have one. To do this, you can copy `.env-dist` or create it manually. `.env-dist` contains the appropriate values to run Carat for the BotC Unofficial discord, aside from the token, which you must add yourself. Make sure to never commit or otherwise upload any file containing the bot token. `.env` (unlike `.env-dist`) is included in the `.gitignore`, so it is safe from this. If you want to run Carat somewhere that is not the BotC Unofficial discord, set the environment variables to the appropriate values. The `.env` has to lie in the same directory as `Carat.py`
4. Create a directory named `data` for Carat to store information in - or if you want its information stored elsewhere, adjust the `STORAGE_LOCATION` in the `.env` accordingly
5. Run AutoRestart.py!
